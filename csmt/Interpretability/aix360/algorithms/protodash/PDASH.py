    ProtodashExplainer provides exemplar-based explanations for summarizing datasets as well
    as explaining predictions made by an AI model. It employs a fast gradient based algorithm
    to find prototypes along with their (non-negative) importance weights. The algorithm minimizes the maximum
    mean discrepancy metric and has constant factor approximation guarantees for this weakly submodular function. [#]_.
